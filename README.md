利用JavaFX创建可视化界面，制作一个有趣的送给朋友的礼物软件，
设置了几个关卡，包含观察、移动、反应力、推理等等小游戏，当然所有的小游戏都暗存通关“秘诀”可以一秒通关，但是不会告诉朋友，当朋友玩到挣扎时，悄悄告诉他通关秘诀
最后可以添加一个自己剪辑的视频和自己写的信，表达对朋友的祝福、友谊长存等等
总的来说是一个提升友谊的小游戏，当然要给自己最好的朋友玩噢，不然怕你会被揍~

在完成了该简单的桌面应用后，尝试制作一个可以自主设置该游戏难度、自主添加视频、信等可以自己简单设计该应用的界面，并让更多人可以自己部署该应用，给他们的朋友游玩。

Use JavaFX to create a visual interface and make an interesting software as a gift for friends. Set up several levels, including small games such as observation, movement, reaction, reasoning, etc. Of course, all the small games have hidden "secrets" to pass the level and can be passed in one second, but they will not tell friends. When your friend struggles, quietly tell him the secret. At the end, you can add a video you edited and a letter you wrote to express your blessings to your friends, lasting friendship, etc. In general, this is a small game to enhance friendship. Of course, you should play it for your best friends, otherwise you may get beaten~ After completing this simple desktop application, try to make an interface that can set the difficulty of the game, add videos and letters, etc., and allow more people to deploy the application themselves and let their friends play.
